This project focuses on data cleansing, data processing, data analyzing, and visualizing graphs on a dataset of Nobel Prize winners. The data cleansing efforts involve identifying and dealing with missing values, outliers, and incorrect or inconsistent data. Data processing entails transforming, combining, and aggregating data to generate new information. Finally, several graphs will be produced based on the newly processed data

Used pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly for visual representations such as pie charts, bar plots, line plots, linear regression as well as Chloropleth maps, Sunburst chart and Raceplots. 

Found several extensive insights between birth country, research organization, age, locations,etc of Nobel Prize Winners.
